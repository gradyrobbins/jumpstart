    <!--  DIRECTION 6: All H1s that are a descendant of class "main-container" should be font-family: 'Luckiest Guy', cursive; (the link for this google font has already been included in the head.) -->

    <!--  DIRECTION 7: All H1s that are DIRECT children (only) of the "main-container" class should have a font color of blue.  -->

    <!--  DIRECTION 8: The "main-container" class should be:
       1. a width of 80% of the screen. It should have a background color of "goldenrod."

       2. It should have a 5px border (style and color of your choosing).
       3. It should be centered on the screen using margin.
       4. It should have 30px of padding between the child elements and the border. (Note: don't overcomplicate that last one. You should use the CSS property padding on the "main-container" element, just giving you the technical terminology for what is happening.) -->
