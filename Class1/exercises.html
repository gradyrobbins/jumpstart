<h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h5>Build a basic blog page that has 3 articles and any random topics you want to talk about. The text can be anything, even placeholder text ( look at this [lorem ipsum text generator ](http://lorem-ipsum.perbang.dk/) for an example of the official unofficial gibberish of web developers everywhere ). The blog page should contain the following:
            </h5>
            <ol>
                <li>A page header containing the blog's title</li>
                <li>A page footer containing the copyright notice (view pretty much any web site to see an example)</li>
                <li>Each article has a header containing a title</li>
                <li>Each article has a footer containing the author and publication date</li>
                <li>Each article has at least one section</li>
            </ol>
