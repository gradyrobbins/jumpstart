## EXERCISES
- [ ] Instructions
Build a basic blog page that has 3 articles and any random topics you want to talk about. The text can be anything, even placeholder text ( look at this lorem ipsum text generator for an example of the official unofficial gibberish of web developers everywhere ). The blog page should contain the following:

1. A page header containing the blog's title
2. A page footer containing the copyright notice (view pretty much any web site to see an example)
3. Each article has a header containing a title
4. Each article has a footer containing the author and publication date
5. Each article has at least one section
