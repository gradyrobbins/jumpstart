- [x] First day of class (Sat):  Build a wireframe of the exercise, using escape characters to illustrate html elements, for example:  **&lt;** h1 **&gt;** LOREMIPSUM **&lt;** /h1 **&gt;**    WIREFRAME ADDED 11/2019

- [ ] Second day of class (Mon):  Illustrate a "before" and "after" version of the fabulous romper and okay door CSS exercise, so students can see what their goal is

- [ ] Fifth day of class improvements (Mon/jQuery): time management; we only made it through the first 2 mini challenges out of 4.
