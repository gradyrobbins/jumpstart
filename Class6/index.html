  <h1>jQuery, FTW!</h1>
  <p id="sonnet">
    How like a winter hath my absence been From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year! What freezings have I felt,
    what dark days seen! What old December's bareness everywhere! And yet this time removed was summer's time; The
    teeming autumn, big with rich increase, Bearing the wanton burden of the prime, Like widow'd wombs after their
    lords' decease: Yet this abundant issue seemed to me But hope of orphans, and unfathered fruit; For summer and his
    pleasures wait on thee, And, thou away, the very birds are mute: Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer, That
    leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
